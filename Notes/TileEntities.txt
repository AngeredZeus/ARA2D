TileEntities exist unaffiliated to chunks.
The World or some other central system should track TileEntities separate from chunks.

Chunks do influence Tile Entities in some sense. When a chunk is loaded, any tile entities living in the chunk should be renderered
When the chunk is unloaded, the rendering entity should be destroyed
In order to accomplish this, either the chunks should track what tile entities are contained within them, or the tile entity system can track what 
ChunkCoords each TileEntity is at, then when the world loads a chunk it can tell the TileEntitySystem to generate renderables for those Coordinates
For TileEntities that exist at the border of a Chunk, we might just want to record where the "anchor" of that TileEntity is and ignore overlap.

TileEntities do take up space, and there should be some way to prevent them from colliding or overlapping. 
In one approach, chunks will also track a separate layer. An int array would store what tile entity is at each tile location.
This takes a lot of unnecessary memory.
A more simplistic approach might be to, whenever we need to check for a collision, 
aggregate the TileEntities that exist in the Chunk in question, and the 8 surrounding chunks.
Then loops through those TileEntities and check for collisions with the tiles in question.
This might take more processing than necessary, but is probably enough for now.
