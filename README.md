## ARA2D
A game about programming robots to make a factory.

I originally planned on making this game in 3D, but over time found that it would be better realized in 2D

### Inspiration
The game draws inspiration from a variety of games:
+ Factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory)
+ Programming games (Exapunk, TIS-100)
+ Minecraft Mods (ComputerCraft, OpenComputers)

### Programming
Robots scripts are run via a reduced command set
```
move
back
left
right
give
take
```

The command set itself is generally not sophisticated enough to get more complicated tasks done. For these types of tasks, the player is allowed to write their own commands with lua.

### Robots
Robots are highly configurable with different upgrades available to suit the task at hand

| Upgrade     | Description                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Battery     | Robot lasts longer before running out of charge|
| Storage     | Robot can store more than one slot of items    |
| Solar Panel?| Robot can generate electricity by itself       |
| TODO        | More ideas                                     |
